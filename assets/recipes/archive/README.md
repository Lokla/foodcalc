# Archive Folder

This folder contains the original individual recipe files that were used before the consolidation into tier-based files.

## Contents
- **42 individual recipe files** for Tier 7 (levels 60-69)
- These files contain the original EverQuest 2 recipe data
- Files are named with the format: `[level] - [Recipe Name].json`

## Why Archived?
These files were consolidated into `tier7.json` for better organization and maintainability. The consolidated file includes:
- All original recipe data
- Enhanced metadata (class, fuel name, yield)
- Harvest information
- Tier-specific organization

## Usage
These files are preserved for:
- Reference purposes
- Data verification
- Historical backup
- Future development needs

The application now loads recipes from the consolidated tier files in the parent directory instead of these individual files.
